                <p>

                    Spotify include in all of the songs, this chart was created using the top 50 of the most

                <h1> Energy </h1>

                <p>
                    Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast,
                    loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the 
                    scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, 
                    timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
                </p>

                <h1>Danceability</h1>

                <p>
                    Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination 
                    of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength,
                    and overall regularity.
                </p>

                <h1> Liveness </h1>

                <p>
                    Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. 
                    Higher liveness values represent an increased
                    probability that the track was performed live.
                </p>

                <h1> Valence </h1>

                <p>
                    A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. 
                    Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), 
                    while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
                </p>

                <h1> Acousticness </h1>

                <p>
                    Represents whether a track is acoustic. 
                </p>

                <h1> Speechiness </h1>

                <p>
